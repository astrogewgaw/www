<div style="text-align: justify">

I am an astrochemist and a radio/pulsar astronomer. I graduated with my Master's in Chemistry and my Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2020. Currently, I am employed at the [**National Centre for Radio Astrophysics** (**NCRA**)](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main) in Pune, and working on building fully-automated data processing pipeline (in other words, I am writing lots of code) to search for pulsars and radio transients (such as **F**ast **R**adio **B**ursts a.k.a. **FRB**s). Most of this work is on my Github in the form of several open-source projects. I am also looking for a Ph.D. position in **astrochemistry**, so if you see something, say something :grin:!
